-- Set vehicle velocity in m/s
-- How it works: Apply enough force to each node, so it accelerates to the target speed in 1 physics tick.
--               Because all nodes accelerate at the same rate, the vehicle will not get ripped apart
-- NOTE: - also affects parts that are detached from the car
--       - very high values can cause instability

-- pos yaw makes it go to the right
-- pos roll makes it roll from left to right
-- pos pitch makes the nose go up


--pitch is pos or growing when the nose is going up
--roll is decreasing from left to right
--yaw goes negative from left to right

-- Set vehicle angular velocity in rad/s
-- How it works: Calculate node tangential velocity relative to car center point at the desired angular velocity
--               and apply enough force to reach the calculated speed in 1 physics tick.
-- NOTE: - will rotate around vehicle position, not center of gravity (calculated COG moves with detached parts)
--         so can cause slight linear movement in some cases
--       - also affects parts that are detached from the car
--       - very high values can destroy vehicles (above about 20-30 rad/s for most cars) or cause instability
--       - can become inaccurate if vehicles are very deformed

		local localTargetAcc = nodePos:cross(vec3(pitchDiff, rollDiff, yawDiff)) -- not sure why, but this works well
		local targetAcc = localTargetAcc:rotated(toWorldAxisQuat) -- rotate force vector to world axis
